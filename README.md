# 🎮 Simon-Says-Game

This is a simple memory based interactive game built using Javascript.
The game generates a sequence of colors, and the player must repeat the sequence correctly. With each level, the sequence becomes longer and more challenging.

This mini project helped me to strengthen my concepts of DOM and this is also a very challenging project for me to think the code.

## 🚀 Features

1. Randomly generates a sequence of color 
2. The user selects a color 
3. Matches the user input with the actual sequence of colors
4. Displays the current level 
5. Reset the game when the user inputs an incorrect sequence.

## ⚒️ Tech Stack

1. Javascript
2. HTML 
3. CSS 

## 💡 Key Learnings

1. Cleared the concepts of DOM 
2. Comparing the user inputed sequence with the game sequence.
3. Storing the sequence in the arrays.

## 🔮 Future Implications

1. Make it Mobile First Game
2. Add Sound Effects
3. Clean UI 
4. Keep track of the user scores
5. User Login and Sign Up
